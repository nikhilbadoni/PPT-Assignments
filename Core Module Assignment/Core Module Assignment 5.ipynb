    "The Naive Approach in machine learning refers to a simple and straightforward method that assumes all features in a dataset are independent of each other. This assumption is called naive because it often doesn't hold true in real-world scenarios. The most common example is the Naive Bayes classifier, where it assumes that the presence of one particular feature does not affect the presence of another. Despite its simplifying assumption, the Naive Approach can be surprisingly effective, especially when dealing with large datasets, text classification, and certain types of data distributions. However, its performance may suffer when faced with highly correlated features or complex relationships between variables."

The plot will resemble an elbow shape, and the optimal K is typically the point where the inertia starts to level off or decreases at a slower rate. This point suggests that adding more clusters does not significantly improve the model's performance.\n",
    "2. Silhouette Score: Calculate the silhouette score for different values of K. The silhouette score measures how well-separated the clusters are and ranges from -1 to 1. Higher values indicate better-defined clusters. The optimal K is the one that maximizes the silhouette score."

    "1. Label Encoding: Assign a unique integer label to each category in the categorical feature. For example, if you have a feature \"Color\" with categories \"Red,\" \"Blue,\" and \"Green,\" you can map them to 0, 1, and 2, respectively. However, be cautious with this approach, as it implies an ordinal relationship between the categories, which may not be appropriate for all categorical variables.\n",
    "2. One-Hot Encoding: Create binary columns for each category in the original feature. Each category becomes a new feature, and its presence is denoted by a 1, while all other columns are set to 0. This way, there is no implied ordinal relationship between the categories.\n",
    "3. Binary Encoding: Replace each category with binary code. This method encodes each category as a binary representation of its integer index. For example, if we have three categories (0, 1, and 2), we can represent them as (00, 01, and 10) in binary format."
