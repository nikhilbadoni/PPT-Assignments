    "The Naive Approach in machine learning refers to a simple and straightforward method that assumes all features in a dataset are independent of each other. This assumption is called naive because it often doesn't hold true in real-world scenarios. The most common example is the Naive Bayes classifier, where it assumes that the presence of one particular feature does not affect the presence of another. Despite its simplifying assumption, the Naive Approach can be surprisingly effective, especially when dealing with large datasets, text classification, and certain types of data distributions. However, its performance may suffer when faced with highly correlated features or complex relationships between variables."

However, be cautious with this approach, as it implies an ordinal relationship between the categories, which may not be appropriate for all categorical variables.\n",

The company decides to use the customer's past purchase history to select features for the model. However, the customer's past purchase history also includes information about the customer's churn status. This means that the target variable (churn status) is leaking into the training set. As a result, the model is likely to overfit the training data and perform poorly on unseen data.\n"
